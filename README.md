A config for polybar highly inspired by polybar-1 in [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes).

## Warning
This config was mainly created by [Aditya Shakya](https://github.com/adi1090x), all I did was modifying the first config of his [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes). 
Hence, it might be that some files are useless in the repository. If so, you can warn me so that I remove them.

## Installation
For the installation of polybar, refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/polybar/polybar).
